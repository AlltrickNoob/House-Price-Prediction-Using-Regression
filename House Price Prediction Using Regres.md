House Price Prediction Using Regression
Project Overview
This project involves predicting house prices using regression techniques on a structured dataset. The aim is to preprocess the data, explore key insights, and build models for accurate prediction. Techniques include feature engineering, handling missing data, and evaluating models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Dataset Description
Dataset: House Price Regression Dataset
Total Records: Multiple (exact count unspecified in report)
Columns: Features include Square_Footage, Lot_Size, Neighborhood_Quality, Year_Built, and House_Price.
Data Quality Issues: Missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in numerical/categorical features.
Project Workflow
Dataset Exploration

Load dataset with pandas.
Summary statistics and distribution visualizations.
Identify outliers and correlations.
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (mean for numerical, mode for categorical).
Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Encode categorical data using OneHotEncoder.
Create new features like Price_Per_Square_Foot and House_Age.
Model Training and Evaluation

Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Metrics: R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Results and Insights

Strong correlation between Square_Footage and House_Price.
Random Forest performed best with an R² score of 0.9858.
